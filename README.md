### 📋 Project Overview
A simple yet complete employee management system implemented in pure C language. This console application demonstrates fundamental data structures and algorithms through practical implementation.

### 🎯 Features
- **Employee Data Management**: Input and store employee ID and name
- **Duplicate Detection**: Automatically detects duplicate IDs during input
- **Sorting Algorithm**: Implements bubble sort to arrange employees by ID
- **Search Functionality**: Uses binary search for efficient employee lookup
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly console interface (Chinese/English ready)
(You will understand more about Function, Array, and some technique like 线性查找)
### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
- **Language**: Pure C (C99 standard)
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, strings
- **Algorithms**: Bubble Sort (O(n²)), Binary Search (O(log n))
- **Memory**: Static allocation (no dynamic memory for simplicity)
- **Input Handling**: Safe input parsing with buffer management

### Usage example:
Enter employee #1 ID: 1001
        Name: John Doe
        
Employee list (sorted by ID):
1001 John Doe
1002 Jane Smith

Enter ID to search: 1001
ID:1001  Name:John Doe

### Attention: This might be not working if your compiler didn't know a thing kwown as CHINESE heshe.
